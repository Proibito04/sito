  <h1>Testing display of HTML elements</h1>

    This page contains a bunch of HTML Elements and text. You can copy the
    source code and use it test out various CSS Properties. For testing
    purposes, you may use <dfn
      >internal styles. Recall that these CSS rules are placed in between the <code

      > tags using the following format:</dfn

  <h6>This is 6th level heading</h6>
  <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>

  <h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

  <p>
    This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element). To add some length to it,
    let us mention that this page was primarily written for testing the effect of
    <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it for various other
    purposes as well, like just checking how your browser displays various HTML
    elements.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is another paragraph. <mark
      >I think it needs to be added that the set of elements tested is not
      exhaustive in any sense.</mark
    > I have selected those elements for which it can make sense to write user style
    sheet rules, in my opinion.
  </p>

  <div>
    This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements instead of
    paragraph markup for various reasons. (End of <code>div</code>.)
  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This is a <i>block quotation</i> containing a single paragraph. Well, not quite,
      since this is not <em>really</em> quoted text, but I hope you understand the
      point. After all, this page does not use HTML markup very normally anyway.

  <h2>Lists</h2>

  <p>
    This is a paragraph before an <strong>unordered</strong> list (<code
      >ul</code
    >). Note that the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after
    that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs
    are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>One.</li>
    <li>Two.</li>
    <li>
      Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for short
      items lists look better if they are compactly presented, whereas for long
      items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
    </li>
    <li>
      Four. This is the last item in this list Let us terminate the list now
      without making any more fuss about it.

  <p>
    This is a paragraph before a <strong>definition</strong> list (<code
      >dl</code
    >). In principle, such a list should consist of <em>terms</em> and associated
    definitions. But many authors use <code>dl</code> elements for fancy "layout"
    things. Usually the effect is not <em>too</em> bad, if you design user style
    sheet rules for <code>dl</code> which are suitable for real definition lists.
