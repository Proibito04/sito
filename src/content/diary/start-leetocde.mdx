A few days ago, I watched a [video](https://youtu.be/8wysIxzqgPI) on YouTube that was talking about LeetCode. The video inspired me to start doing some coding tests, so today is the first day of my LeetCode journey. I started with this [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).

I completed the first three problems (the easy ones) and I realized that the answers weren't too obvious. It's interesting to see what approaches people experiment with. My goal is to solve at least one problem per day.

I admit, I wasn't the perfect scholar. I missed some days at the beginning. I started doing LeetCode, but after only 15 days, I stopped.

But fortunately, after nearly two or three months, I was able to start again, and today marks my 60-day streak.

It's very useful, and I recommend to everyone to start practicing LeetCode every day; you will improve your programming skills.

It's a generic post, I know. I have to organize what I've learned. I will update soon to organize my ideas.
