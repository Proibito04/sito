A few days ago, I watched a [video](https://youtu.be/8wysIxzqgPI) on YouTube that was talking about LeetCode. The video inspired me to start doing some coding tests, so today is the first day of my LeetCode journey. I started with this [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).

I completed the first three problems (the easy ones) and I realized that the answers weren't too obvious. It's interesting to see what approaches people experiment with. My goal is to solve at least one problem per day.
